This project demonstrates a scalable workflow for generating patient-reported symptom lists for medical conditions using open Large Language Models (LLMs) on the **Vlaams Supercomputer (VSC)**.

---

## Research Objective

For a curated set of diseases (ICD codes) sourced from the *MIMIC-IV* clinical database, we systematically prompt open LLMs to produce **exactly 10 common symptoms** per condition. The outputs are saved in structured formats (JSON/Parquet) for downstream clinical data science.

The workflow illustrates how to:

- Set up and work efficiently on HPC (High-Performance Computing).
- Understand credits and resource allocation on VSC.
- Configure and prepare the compute environment.
- Download and manage open-source LLMs for clinical tasks.
- Orchestrate compute jobs using SLURM (including ready-to-use script templates)
- Process LLM prompts and collect results.
- Extract and structure outputs for analysis (JSONL/Parquet).
- Apply best practices for running large-scale jobs on HPC
- Address basic ethical considerations in generative AI for healthcare

## Data Source: MIMIC-IV

[MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv) (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) is a publicly available, de-identified database containing detailed records from ICU patients, including:
- Clinical notes and documentation
- Diagnostic codes (ICD-9/ICD-10)
- Laboratory and vital sign measurements
- Medication and procedure records

### Data Access Requirements

In order to access the data the following have to be fulfilled: 

1. Complete CITI training (or equivalent human subjects research training)
2. Obtain institutional approval through [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/)
3. Sign and comply with the official MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement

> **Note:**  
> _In this workflow, only disease names and ICD codes were submitted to LLMs. No patient-level or identifying data was used or transmitted._

# Credits on VSC

- VSC uses a credit-based system for resource management.
    - Credits are consumed according to CPU/GPU hours and memory usage.
- How to check your credit balance:
    - Use the `vsc-accounting` command in the terminal.
    - Or check online: [VSC Accounting Dashboard](https://www.vscentrum.be/nl/accounting)
- Credits are requested via your institution.
    - See the [resource application guide](https://www.vscentrum.be/en/access/vsc-projects).

# SLURM Jobs

- All computation on VSC is managed by the SLURM workload manager.
    - Prepare a SLURM batch script with resource requests and commands.
- Example SLURM script:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --job-name=llm-symptoms
    #SBATCH --output=logs/%x-%j.out
    #SBATCH --partition=normal
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks=1
    #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
    #SBATCH --mem=32G
    #SBATCH --time=02:00:00

    module load Python/3.10.4-GCCcore-11.3.0
    python scripts/generate_symptoms.py --input data/icd_codes.csv --output data/symptoms_llm_output.jsonl
    ```

- Submit your job:
    ```bash
    sbatch run_job.sh
    ```
- Monitor job status:
    ```bash
    squeue -u $USER
    ```

# VSC File System & Architecture

- **Where does your data live?**
    - `$HOME`: For code, scripts, and small files (backed up).
    - `$VSC_DATA`: For large datasets and results (not backed up by default).
    - `$VSC_SCRATCH`: For temporary files and outputs (fast, auto-purged).
    - See [Data Storage at VSC](https://www.vscentrum.be/en/user-info/files-and-data)

- **Where does your code live?**
    - Usually in `$HOME` or in `$VSC_DATA/scripts`.
    - Use version control (e.g., Git) for code management.

- **Where does your terminal/session live?**
    - Connect via SSH:
        ```bash
        ssh <vsc_user>@login.hpc.ugent.be
        ```
        - Or see [Accessing VSC](https://www.vscentrum.be/en/user-info/accessing-the-vsc)
    - Only use the login node for setup, file transfer, and job submission.
    - Run compute jobs via SLURM, not directly on the login node.

# Tips

- Organize your project with separate folders for code, data, and logs.
- Monitor your credit and storage usage.

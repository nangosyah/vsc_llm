## Project Context

This site is a practical guide for deploying, managing, and analyzing large language models (LLMs) using the Vlaams Supercomputer (VSC).

This project was completed as part of my internship, under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Dirk Valkenborg](https://www.uhasselt.be/nl/wie-is-wie/dirk-valkenborg) and Jimmy Schepers.  
Their support and mentorship were instrumental in bringing this work to fruition.

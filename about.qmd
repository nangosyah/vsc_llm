# ðŸ‘‹ Project Overview

## Research Objective
This project demonstrates a scalable approach to generating patient-reported symptom lists for medical conditions using open Large Language Models (LLMs) on the **Vlaams Supercomputer (VSC)**. For a curated set of diseases (ICD codes) sourced from the *MIMIC-IV* clinical database, we systematically prompt LLMs to produce **exactly 10 common symptoms** per condition. The structured outputs (JSONL/Parquet) are prepared for downstream analysis including frequency mapping and ontology alignment.

## Pedagogical Value
Through this workflow, researchers will learn:
- HPC job orchestration using SLURM arrays
- Batch processing of LLM queries with error handling
- Structured output extraction (JSONL/Parquet)
- Reproducible research practices
- Ethical considerations for clinical NLP

## 1. Data Source: MIMIC-IV

### Overview
**MIMIC-IV** (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) is a de-identified, publicly accessible database of ICU patient records from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, containing:
- Clinical documentation
- Diagnostic codes (ICD-9/10)
- Vital signs and laboratory measurements
- Medication records

### Access Requirements
1. Completion of CITI training or equivalent
2. Institutional approval via PhysioNet
3. Compliance with Data Use Agreement ([physionet.org/content/mimiciv](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv))

### Implementation Note
Only **disease names and ICD codes** are submitted to LLMs. No patient-level data is transmitted. Source version (`mimic-iv-2.2`) is documented in `data/README.md`.
